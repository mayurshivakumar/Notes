Tests api end points in PSN . 
newman -c PSN.json.postman_collection -e Dev.postman_environment
 
PSN.json.postman_collection - tells what test to run 
Dev.postman_environment - what host to run the tests against. 
PSN should be running in order for this to work .

Just regular go tests can be run by going into the directory 
go test - will run all the tests in the dir.
 To run a specific test 
go test file_test.go file_worker.go
 
Generate mocks using mockgen
godep restore should get you both gomock and mockgen.  I had to install mockgen manually . Once installed you can  generate mocks using below command.
 
mockgen -source=source_file.go -destination=destination_file_mock.go -package=package_name
 mocks needs to be up to date. Else test will fail . You can run the above command to regenerate or recreate it.
